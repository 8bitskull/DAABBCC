# DAABBCC
AABBs tree native extension for Defold Engine

## About
DAABBCC is a C++ wrapper of [AABB.cc](https://github.com/lohedges/aabbcc) lib for Defold Engine. [AABB.cc](https://github.com/lohedges/aabbcc) is developed by [Lester Hedges](http://lesterhedges.net) and released under the [Zlib](http://zlib.net/zlib_license.html) license. The code in [AABB.cc](https://github.com/lohedges/aabbcc) library was adapted from parts of the [Box2D](http://www.box2d.org) physics engine. DAABBCC is a native wrapper developed by [Selim Ana√ß](https://twitter.com/selimanac)

DAABBCC is a C++ implementation of a dynamic bounding volume hierarchy ([BVH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy)) using axis-aligned bounding boxes ([AABBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box)).
The data structure provides an efficient way of detecting potential overlap between objects of arbitrary shape and size and is commonly used in computer games engines for collision detection and ray tracing.
